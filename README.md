WhereIsAlberto.com web-application project

This is the Graphical-User-Interface-front-side prototype, where users and stakeholders can experiment, test and have a better idea of what they really want.

I have used HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript libraries such as BootStrap and JQuery to offer a better compatibility between browsers and a better responsiveness across different size devices. (smartphone, tablet, PC)

Javascript are used to mimic and simulate the server side/database behavior. Some of the libraries are available on-line using the CDN Content Delivery Networks/Geo-location/Google-Map. 

Therefore, to take advantage of this web-app and have a better users' experience, you should use a recent browser (Firefox, IE) with an internet connection, enable javascript and share your Geo-location.
