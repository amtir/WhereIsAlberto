WhereIsAlberto? This is a web-application designed to trace and track the previous and next locations and owners of special banknotes, stamped and registered in our database.

CHF 100 - Alberto Giacometti and his sculpture L'Homme qui marche I appear on the current 100 Swiss Franc banknote. More about the artist Alberto on wikipedia under the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Giacometti

The PHP server back side php script has been added using the codeigniter free, lightweight, M-V-C framework.
By this means we generate custom dynamic pages and adds another more secure layer on the server side prior to insert/save or retrieve data from the MySQL database server.

With some operating systems/devices, the geo-location is disabled and we won't be able to get the gps coordinates.
Therefore, I added a request to decode users' addresses via google geolocation api web-service and get back the gps address.

In this commit I have implemented a GUI, a Graphical-User-Interface-front-side prototype, where users and stakeholders can experiment, test and have a better idea of what they really want.

I have used HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript libraries such as BootStrap and JQuery to offer a better compatibility between browsers and a better responsiveness across different size devices. (smartphone, tablet, PC)

Javascript is used to mimic and simulate the server side/database behavior. Some of the libraries are available on-line using the CDN Content Delivery Networks/Geo-location/Google-Map. 

Therefore, to take advantage of this web-app and have a better users' experience, you should use a recent browser (Firefox, IE) with an internet connection, enable javascript and share your Geo-location.
